# Student PerFormance Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning algorithms. The dataset and model in this repository allow for an analysis of various factors impacting student outcomes, with the goal of supporting educational decision-making and personalized learning strategies.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical data to prepare it for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics are used to analyze patterns and relationships within the data.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and others to predict student performance.
Performance Evaluation: Model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall help to assess the efficacy of predictions.
